# UrduCorpus-TransformerFineTuning
 Repository for fine-tuning transformers (BERT, Distil-BERT, XLM-Roberta) on custom Urdu datasets. This project adapts pre-trained models using a Twitter dataset and UrduDataBulk to enhance performance for Urdu NLP tasks. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

UrduCorpus-TransformerFineTuning
This repository contains code for fine-tuning transformer models on a custom Urdu text corpus. The primary goal is to adapt pre-trained transformer models to better understand and process Urdu text.

Code Explanation
1. Installation
Ensure that the required libraries are installed. The key dependencies are:

transformers
torch
datasets
2. Importing Libraries
The code starts by importing necessary libraries:

torch for working with PyTorch.
transformers for transformer models and tokenizers.
LineByLineTextDataset and DataCollatorForLanguageModeling for preparing the dataset and collating data for training.
Trainer and TrainingArguments for setting up and running the training process.
3. Loading the Tokenizer
The AutoTokenizer from the transformers library is used to load the tokenizer for the XLM-RoBERTa model. This tokenizer will process the input text to be compatible with the model.

4. Preparing the Dataset
The LineByLineTextDataset class is used to load and preprocess the Urdu text dataset. It reads text from a file and prepares it for training by dividing it into blocks of a specified size.

5. Creating the Data Collator
The DataCollatorForLanguageModeling is created to handle the data formatting for masked language modeling. This collator randomly masks tokens in the input text to train the model on predicting the masked tokens.

6. Loading the Pre-trained Model
The pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model is loaded using XLMRobertaForMaskedLM. This model is specifically designed for masked language modeling tasks.

7. Setting Up Training Arguments
The TrainingArguments class is used to configure the training process, including the output directory, number of training epochs, batch size, and other parameters.

8. Setting Up the Trainer
The Trainer class is initialized with the model, training arguments, data collator, and the dataset. It manages the training loop and handles the model training process.

9. Training the Model
The trainer.train() method is called to start the fine-tuning process. During training, the model learns to better handle the Urdu text based on the custom dataset.

10. Saving the Model
After training, the trainer.save_model() method saves the fine-tuned model to a specified directory. This model can then be used for further NLP tasks or evaluations.

Usage
To use this repository:

Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Place your Urdu text dataset in the specified file path.
Run the code to start fine-tuning the model.
Use the saved model for Urdu NLP tasks.
